    "distance": "4.0 miles",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "description": "This is a very popular trail in the summer months. It is a short 30 minute drive from downtown Bellevue or under an hour away from Seattle. Not only does this trail provide you with great panoramic views from atop Rattlesnake Ridge but there is also a great park located down below. Many people come to the use the lake in the warmer months. There are no motored boats or fishing allowed on the lake which makes this place ideal for kayakers and swimmers alike."

    "location": "Issaquah Alps",
    "distance": "0.4 mils",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "description": "This is a great hike for you to take the kids on. The trail is short and has almost no elevation change to it. It also provides a little education on how the forest and its animals work together to form an ecosystem. You will follow Field Mouse, who is the lead character, while he takes his first hike into the forest. Along the way he will encounter several of the forest inhabitants who educate him on their jobs in the forest. As you follow along on his journey you will meet a crow, bugs, tree frog, woodpecker, beaver, and a squirrel. Each one of them will explain their role in the forest."

    "location": "Bellevue, WA",
    "distance": "2.2 miles",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "description": " This trail is an excellent finish to the four trails of Coal Creek Park. This trail offers the best views of Coal Creek and offers more of a challenge. The hills are not terribly steep but there are many and opportunity to rest is few. This trail is just over 4 miles out and back. I think it provides the best views of Coal Creek and will be the best hike in Coal Creek Park when all improvements have been completed."
